Presentation Layer:
This layer handles the user interface and user interactions.
It captures user input and displays output to the user.
It interacts with the application layer to perform calculations and retrieve results.
Application Layer:
The application layer contains the core logic of the calculator.
It processes input from the presentation layer, performs calculations, and produces results.
It does not directly interact with the user interface but communicates with the presentation layer to receive input and send output.
Domain Layer:
The domain layer encapsulates the business logic and domain-specific rules of the calculator.
It defines the data types, operations, and rules for performing calculations.
It ensures the integrity and consistency of calculations and results.
Data Access Layer:
For a simple calculator app, a data access layer may not be necessary since there might not be a need to interact with external data sources.
However, if the calculator app needs to store user preferences, history, or settings, a data access layer could be implemented to manage data storage and retrieval.
